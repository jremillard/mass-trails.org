    <h2>Trail Maps with OpenStreetMap</h2>
        
    <p>Making maps is a lot of work! Conservation groups often struggle sharing trail maps 
       with the public. The maps need to be created for many media: paper, 
       Internet, and mobile, they need to be kept up to date, and are often created 
       using specialized software.       
    
    <p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) is a non-profit collaborative project to create a free, 
        editable map of the entire world. It is like Wikipedia for maps, with over 30,000 members every month 
        logging in and editing the OpenStreetMap map. The data is freely shared via <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/">
        Open Data Commons Open Database License</a> and not owned by a for profit entity. 
    </p>

    <p> The maps can be edited directly on the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> site. The 
        people that know the trails and properties the best can make the maps themselves.
        The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project effortlessly backs up, hosts, and 
        distributes your trail data to the multitude of map makers for free. 
        
    <ul>
        <li><p>Most outdoor <b>mobile apps</b> already use OSM, such as: <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/">AllTrails</a>, <a href="http://osmand.net/">OsmAnd</a>, 
            <a href="http://support.motionx.com/">Motion GPX</a>. When you update the map data in OSM
             it is distributed effortlessly for you to the mobile apps.</p></li>        
        <li><p><b>Online Interactive mapping</b> support can be provided on sites like this one, directly on the
            the OpenStreetMap site, or from within your website.</p></li>            
        <li><p>Garman <b>GPS Units</b> can be <a href="http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/">loaded</a> OpenStreetMap data.</p></li>
        <li><p>The OSM website can be exported to pdf or png for printing <b>Paper</b> maps.</p></li>
        <li><p>With a some technical savy, a fully <b>custom map</b> can be deployed on your 
            conservation website, or a GIS person can make a map with ArcGIS using the OSM trail data.</p></li>
    </ul>        

    <h2>Editing OpenStreetMap</h2>
    <p>For people new to computer maps they often expect that map making is similar to a drawing application, like 
       Adobe Photoshop, or even MS-Paint. However digital map making is actually two steps, first the essential map data 
       is collected and entered. For example, if you want to map a path. You would first enter the path location as a line, and then describe the 
       paths attributes such as: how wide is it, what the ground is like, is it private or public, what color blazes are used to 
       mark it, who maintains it, are bikes allowed, horses, pets, is it wheelchair accessible, etc. 
       The second step is creating the map where the map maker decides how objects are depicted.
       This data/map separation allows different kinds of maps to be created from the same underlying data.
     </p>
    <p>OpenStreetMap uses a system of "tagging" data. To map a trail, the location of the trail is first drawn as a line, then
        the trail is "tagged", with the highway=path name value. An actual highway is a highway=trunk, a fire road would
        be highway=track. Most of the effort in using OpenStreetMap is learning this name/value tagging vocabulary to property
        describe the feature being mapped.</p>
    </ul>
