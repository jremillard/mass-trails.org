* general

layers are in different orders with different options on various pages.
Not sure why, but seems like it should be consistent.

On some pages, you list "type" and that's fine, but it would be  cool to
have the properties color-coded by type, perhaps using the OSM carto
color plus the dark green they should use for conservation.

You don't seem to address farm, and that's funny, as there are farms
with and without APR, and they are sort of "open space" but not "public
open space".  But that blurs a plain CR with landuse=conservation with
one that has town ownership or access.

How you get from OSM to the website is complicated, so it would be great
to have a "data origins and processing" page (need better name) that
explains how you treat the tags and is careful to point out where you
depart from the carto or standard approach.   

I wonder what you think about coloring the trails.

I find that the map does not fit on my (2014 mac air) screen, whereas
most sites it seems to fit the window somehow.  So it's really awkward
to scroll since I have to use the margin, and then I lose the layers
selector.

not sure how to fix.
